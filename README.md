Mobile application for GateMate available on Android, built using Flutter.

## Mission

Rice provides [21% of global human per capita energy and 15% of per capita protein](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9231551/#:~:text=Rice%2C%20a%20staple%20food%20for,(United%20Nations%2C%202017).). The United States is a top exporter of rice globally. Water conservation is a significant concern to the agricultural community at large, and rice production requires significant amounts of standing water for growth.

A process referred to as alternate wetting and drying (AWD) aims to conserve water without reducing yield, but it is labor intensive and prone to guesswork. Currently, producers must manually raise and lower gates that are spread out across fields that are potentially [thousands of acres large](https://www.nass.usda.gov/Surveys/Guide_to_NASS_Surveys/Ag_Resource_Management/ARMS_2014_Rice_Highlights.pdf) according to many factors such as crop lifecycle, weather, and soil characteristics. The GateMate project aims to automate the task of field setup and management through remote-controlled levee gates.
