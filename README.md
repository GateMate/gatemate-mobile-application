# GateMate Mobile

Mobile application for GateMate available on Android, built using Flutter.

## Mission

Rice provides [21% of global human per capita energy and 15% of per capita protein](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9231551/#:~:text=Rice%2C%20a%20staple%20food%20for,(United%20Nations%2C%202017).). The United States is a top exporter of rice globally. Water conservation is a significant concern to the agricultural community at large, and rice production requires significant amounts of standing water for growth.

A process referred to as alternate wetting and drying (AWD) aims to conserve water without reducing yield, but it is labor intensive and prone to guesswork. Currently, producers must manually raise and lower gates that are spread out across fields that are potentially [thousands of acres large](https://www.nass.usda.gov/Surveys/Guide_to_NASS_Surveys/Ag_Resource_Management/ARMS_2014_Rice_Highlights.pdf) according to many factors such as crop lifecycle, weather, and soil characteristics. The GateMate project aims to automate the task of field setup and management through remote-controlled levee gates.

This project was completed for the Computer Science and Computer Engineering Capstone course at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville. We would like to thank our sponsor, Timothy White, for his valuable agricultural insight and feedback throughout the development process. His passion for sustainable rice production brought GateMate to life.

### Running the app

Set up your Flutter environment according to the instructions found [here](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install). Then, clone this repository:

`git clone https://github.com/GateMate/gatemate-mobile-application.git`

The easiest way to then install the application onto a device (physical or emulated) is to install Visual Studio Code and the Flutter extension. The [official documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/editor?tab=vscode) may be useful here as well.

Alternatively, inside of the cloned repository's folder at a command line interface, enter the following:

`flutter pub get`

`flutter run`

If you encounter any issues with Flutter setup, please refer to Flutter's official documentation. If you experience any issues while attempting to run the application, please open an issue [here](https://github.com/GateMate/gatemate-mobile-application/issues)! We would love to hear your feedback.
